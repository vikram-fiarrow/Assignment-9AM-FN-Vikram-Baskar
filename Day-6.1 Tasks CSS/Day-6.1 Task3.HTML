    <h1>North Korea</h1>
    <p>The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), or North Korea, is a highly isolated, one-party socialist
        republic under a totalitarian hereditary dictatorship led by Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un. The government
        exercises strict control over nearly all aspects of public and private life, systematically denying basic
        liberties, including freedom of expression and movement</p>

    <h2>North Korea's GDP</h2>
    <p>North Korea's economy is a centrally planned system with limited market mechanisms, which makes reliable GDP
        calculation difficult; estimates are often provided by external sources like South Korea's central bank.
        According to 2024 estimates by the Bank of Korea, North Korea's nominal GDP stands at approximately $32 billion,
        with a real GDP growth rate of around 3.7%. </p>

    <h3>North Korea's Festivals</h3>
    <p>North Korean festivals are primarily state-orchestrated events designed to reinforce the ruling Kim dynasty's
        personality cult and national ideology. The most significant holidays are the Day of the Sun (April 15th, Kim Il
        Sung's birthday) and the Day of the Shining Star (February 16th, Kim Jong Il's birthday), which feature grand
        festivities such as mass parades, fireworks, mass gymnastics (like the Arirang Mass Games, when they are held),
        and artistic performances.</p>
