        document.getElementById(id) /*== single element selection by id fast / returns the element object*/

        // Use getElementById when you need to select a single element by its 
        // unique ID, as it is the fastest method available.For selecting elements by class name or tag name, 
        // getElementsByClassName and getElementsByTagName are suitable, 
        // but they return live HTML collections which can be less flexible.
        // For more complex selections, especially when using CSS selectors, 
        // querySelector and querySelectorAll are preferred due to their versatility and 
        // ability to select multiple elements easily.

        // HTMLCollection is live: modify the DOM, and the collection updates automatically.
