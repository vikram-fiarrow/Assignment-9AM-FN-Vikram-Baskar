    <h1>Welcome to India's own Website</h1>
    <h2>About Tamilnadu</h2>
    <p>Explore Tamil Nadu was founded by someone born in Tamil Nadu and raised in Singapore, driven by a passion to
        connect with their roots and share them with others. This website aims to promote Tamil Nadu’s rich heritage,
        travel experiences, and culinary wonders to both locals and international visitors. It highlights not just the
        popular tourist attractions but also the lesser-known treasures — the quiet beaches, the mountain trails, and
        the small towns filled with warmth and culture. Through stories, guides, and photos, this website hopes to
        inspire people everywhere to explore, experience, and fall in love with the soul of Tamil Nadu.
