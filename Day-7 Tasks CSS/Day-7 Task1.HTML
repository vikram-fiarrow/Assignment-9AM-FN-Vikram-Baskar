    <p>
        Korea refers to the Korean Peninsula in East Asia, which is currently divided into two countries: North Korea
        and South Korea. South Korea, or the Republic of Korea, is a democratic country with a capital in Seoul, while
        North Korea is a communist state with its capital in Pyongyang. The peninsula is politically divided by the
        Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which runs along the 38th parallel, a border established after World War II.
