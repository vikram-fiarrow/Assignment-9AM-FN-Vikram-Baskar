    <h1>Korean War</h1>
    <p>Relations between South Korea and North Korea are currently marked by significant tension, as dialogue and peace
        overtures from the South have been largely dismissed by the North. North Korea has officially designated South
        Korea as a hostile state, removed the goal of unification from its constitution, and taken steps like blasting
        sections of inter-Korean road and rail links. While South Korea's current government seeks to rebuild trust and
        avoid "unification by absorption," North Korea's top officials view these gestures as a "pipe dream" and have no
        interest in reconciliation proposals. The broader relationship remains strained by the North's nuclear weapons
        program and its alignment with other nations like Russia.
