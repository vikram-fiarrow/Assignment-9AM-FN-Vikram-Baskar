    <p class="about">
        Hello! My name is Vikram Baskar Fiarrow. I am originally from Singapore, but I was born in Cuddalore and moved to
Singapore when I was a 2-month-old baby. I did most of my schooling both in Singapore and India, then moved to
Lithuania and Thailand for my bachelor's degree. I have completed my Bachelor's in Modern Business Management, majoring
in marketing and minoring in management.
